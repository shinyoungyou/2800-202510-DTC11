## Overview
A summary of the appâ€™s aim and the context that inspired its creation.

We created an allergy scanning app that allows users to quickly check products if they contain specific ingredients by scanning a product's label or barcode. This app is designed for people with allergies or health-conscious consumers so that they can save time and reduce the potential for user error when checking ingredients.

Install Visual Studio Code, clone the repository from GitHub, navigate to the backend directory, run `npm install` to fetch dependencies, then create a `.env` file and add a Gemini API key.

## Usage

Run the backend server, open the app on your mobile device, and scan or search a product to see real-time allergen insights.
